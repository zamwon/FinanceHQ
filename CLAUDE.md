# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

FinanceHQ — a personal finance obligation tracker. See @context/foundation/prd.md for full requirements and @context/foundation/tech-stack.md for stack decisions.

## Stack

- Java 21, Spring Boot 4.0.6, Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`)
- PostgreSQL (all environments — no H2)
- Angular frontend at `src/main/frontend/`
- Root package: `com.example.finance_hq` (underscores, not hyphens — Java package naming requirement)

## Commands

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run    # start backend dev server
./mvnw test               # run all tests
./mvnw clean package      # build jar
```

Angular frontend (run from `src/main/frontend/`):
```bash
ng serve
```

Single test: `./mvnw test -Dtest=ClassName#methodName`

## Architecture

REST API backend (Spring MVC) + Angular SPA in the same repo. Backend serves JSON; Angular is a separate build at `src/main/frontend/`.

## Git conventions

Branch names: `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>`.

## Key notes

- No linting configured (no Checkstyle, SpotBugs). Run tests to validate changes.
- Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, and JavaMail are not yet in pom.xml — add them when implementing auth, persistence, and notifications.
- Tests use JUnit Jupiter with `@SpringBootTest`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code isolation** | |
| `git worktree add` | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree. |
| **Complex changes** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution. |
| **Simple changes** | |
| `/goal` | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p` | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern. |
| **Multi-session orchestration** | |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them. |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
