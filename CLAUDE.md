# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

FinanceHQ — a personal finance obligation tracker. See @context/foundation/prd.md for full requirements and @context/foundation/tech-stack.md for stack decisions.

## Stack

- Java 21, Spring Boot 4.0.6, Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`)
- PostgreSQL (all environments — no H2)
- Angular frontend at `src/main/frontend/`
- Root package: `com.example.finance_hq` (underscores, not hyphens — Java package naming requirement)

## Commands

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run    # start backend dev server
./mvnw test               # run all tests
./mvnw clean package      # build jar
```

Angular frontend (run from `src/main/frontend/`):
```bash
ng serve
```

Single test: `./mvnw test -Dtest=ClassName#methodName`

## Architecture

REST API backend (Spring MVC) + Angular SPA in the same repo. Backend serves JSON; Angular is a separate build at `src/main/frontend/`.

## Git conventions

Branch names: `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>`.

## Key notes

- No linting configured (no Checkstyle, SpotBugs). Run tests to validate changes.
- Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, and JavaMail are not yet in pom.xml — add them when implementing auth, persistence, and notifications.
- Tests use JUnit Jupiter with `@SpringBootTest`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 4 (E2E Tests)

**For E2E tests, use the `/10x-e2e` skill.** It is the single source of truth
for the workflow — risk → seed test + rules → generate → review against the five
anti-patterns → re-prompt → verify. The skill's `references/` carry the full
rules, anti-patterns, seed pattern, and prompt-template.

A few hard rules that hold even before you invoke the skill:

- **Locators:** `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText` first; `getByTestId`
  only when accessibility attributes are ambiguous. Never CSS selectors, XPath,
  or DOM structure.
- **Never `page.waitForTimeout()`.** Wait for state: `toBeVisible()`,
  `waitForURL()`, `waitForResponse()`.
- **Test independence + cleanup.** Each test runs standalone — its own setup,
  action, assertion, and cleanup; unique ids (timestamp suffix) so parallel runs
  and re-runs don't collide.

Two boundaries to keep straight:

- **DOM (snapshot) is the default.** Vision (`--caps=vision`) is a supplement for
  visual-only risks (layout, z-index, animation); for pixel regression prefer
  deterministic tools (`toMatchSnapshot`, Argos, Lost Pixel). VLM model
  selection/cost is a debugging topic (Lesson 5), not testing.
- **Healer helps on selectors, harms on logic.** A changed selector → healer
  re-finds it (route through PR review). A changed business behavior → healer
  masks the bug; that failing-test-to-fix case is Lesson 5.
